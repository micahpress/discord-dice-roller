# Discord Dice Rolling Bot

## Overview

This is a dice-rolling bot I made for Discord servers being used to play Dungeons & Dragons.
There's no reason it can't be used for other purposes, but most of the functionality is modeled after D&D use-cases.
This repo contains the base files that the bot uses, but doesn't contain the Discord token needed to run the bot.

## Files

[main.py](https://github.com/micahpress/discord-dice-roller/blob/master/main.py) contains the execution logic, while other files contain classes used in the main program file.
